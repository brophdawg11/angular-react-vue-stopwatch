    <h1>React/Vue Comparison</h1>
    <p>
        Below are two 'stopwatch' components, each with identical functionality.
        In this page right now are two separate applications written in two separate frameworks - neat, eh?
    </p>
    <p>To use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start: Starts the stopwatch</li>
        <li>Stop: Pauses the stopwatch</li>
        <li>Reset: Clears the stopwatch and adds the elapsed time to a history of previous times</li>
        <li>Once each watch is started a 'net time' display will show how much total time has been run on that watch since page load</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While simple, these features show off the fundamental aspects of each framework - user interaction, conditional rendering,
        dynamically-computed display values, event handling, state management, and async data updates.
