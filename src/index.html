    <h1>Angular, React, and Vue Comparison</h1>
    <p>
        Below are three 'stopwatch' components, each with identical functionality.
        In this page right now are three separate applications written in three separate frameworks - neat, eh?
    </p>
    <p>To use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start: Starts the stopwatch</li>
        <li>Stop: Pauses the stopwatch</li>
        <li>Reset: Clears the stopwatch and adds the elapsed time to a history of previous times</li>
        <li>Once each watch is started a 'net time' display will show how much total time has been run on that watch since page load</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While simple, these features show off the fundamental aspects of each framework - user interaction, conditional rendering,
        dynamically-computed display values, event handling, state management, and async data updates.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Important note:</b> I have done some very basic optimizations to reduce bundle bloat but have not given these the full production treatment. You can see
        in your dev tools that the Vue and React bundles are pretty small (but not tiny) and the Angular bundle is massive - this is because
        I have not enabled Ahead-of-Time compilation and other production features for this example, so don't get fixated on those numbers since
        they aren't realistic.
