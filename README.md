Comparison of setting up a simple UI in Angular 4, React 15, and Vue 2

[This blog post](https://objectpartners.com/2017/07/25/angular-react-or-vue-js-which-one-is-for-me/) gives a little more insight into what's going on.

## Description
I have created a very simple UI (a stopwatch) in Angular, React, and Vue that _**should**_
look and behave exactly the same way. The idea is to make it easier to see how each framework
tackles some of the basic features needed for UI development and allow you to compare and contrast
each approach.

## Usage

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

Start each stopwatch with the 'Start' button, pause it with 'Stop'. 'Reset' will clear the timer
and add the elapsed time to an list of previous times.
