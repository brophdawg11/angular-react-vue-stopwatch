Comparison of setting up a simple UI in Angular 4, React 15, and Vue 2

## Description
I have created a very simple UI (a stopwatch) in Angular, React, and Vue that _**should**_
look and behave exactly the same way. The idea is to make it easier to see how each framework
tackles some of the basic features needed for UI development and allow you to compare and contrast
each approach.

## Usage
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
